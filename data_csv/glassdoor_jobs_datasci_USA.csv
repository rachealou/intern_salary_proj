We're hiring computer-based personalized genomics research scientists. Our ideal candidates will possess keen intellects, immense curiosity and superior knowledge of personalized genomics and the genetics of aging and age-related diseases.
InVitro Cell Research (ICR) is dedicated to solving some of the most difficult problems in aging and age-related disease. We're a growing company with a small-group vibe and a highly collaborative environment. We provide our scientists with the state-of-the-art resources they need to leverage their time and skills most effectively, empowering small teams of scientists to accomplish what would otherwise require much larger teams.
Interested in joining us?
As an ICR Genomics Scientist, you'll get to:
Be a ""Genome Detective"": conduct in-depth analyses of whole genome, whole exome, epigenetic, and gene expression data to discover potential disease-associated traits and identify practical, actionable therapeutic targets for disease prevention and interventional therapy.
Compose personalized genomics reports resulting from extensive research on specific genetic conditions or diseases. This includes summarizing existing literature, as well as identifying and evaluating the effects of both known and novel genetic variants and determining their effects on disease.
Conduct routine and complex genomics analyses on next-gen sequencing data, including DNA variant calling, CNV and structural variation analysis, mitochondrial DNA variation, family-based analysis (transmission, de novo variants).
We'd love to hear from you if you background includes at least the following:
PhD, MD or both in a biomedical sciences field like genomics with at least 3-years post-doctoral experience
In-depth knowledge of personalized genomics, disease risk analysis (including polygenic risk modeling) and age-related disease genetics
Experience with next-gen genome analysis software for variant calling and interpretation (e.g. GATK, VCF/BCFtools, IGV, PLINK, Annovar, SNPeff, Promethease, other online and open-source software) and bioinformatics databases (e.g. 1000 Genomes, ExAC, NCBI, EBI, Ensembl, dbSNP, COSMIC, etc)
Extensive programming experience and working knowledge of diverse programming languages (especially Python and R); ability to work in Linux
It would be great if you also have:
Experience in variant curation: determining the functional effects of a genetic variant (pathogenic/benign) using multiple sources of information (literature searches, functional prediction algorithms, integration of results from other assays performed in the lab)
Extensive working knowledge of genomic, epigenetic, SNP and gene expression datasets.
Experience with methods for disease risk prediction using primarily genetic data (e.g. polygenic models), but also with the possibility of integrating any number of epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, etc. datasets
Knowledge of Bayesian statistical methods and biostatistics in general
Personal interest in their own genetics (i.e. you've done 23andMe, Promethease, other self-genetic testing services, etc)
General and working knowledge of aging biology, adult stem cells, and regenerative and personalized medicine are also desirable
And you'll definitely need:
Excellent English-language speaking and writing skills
A strong ability to summarize and communicate complex genetic ideas quickly and effectively in both written reports and oral discussions and presentations
The ability to work in the United States without sponsorship
To have an easy going, hard-working personality
